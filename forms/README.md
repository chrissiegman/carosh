This is a traditional approach to the forms exercise, using simple HTML, vanilla php, and MySQL.
In a production environment, I would likely import Symfony components (router, templating, etc.)
and treat this project in a more object-oriented fashion. However, this approach satisfies the
basic minimum requirements and has a straightforward implementation.

The database schema is outlined in "persons.sql" and assumes a MySQL server.
