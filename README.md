All required functions have been implemented in vanilla PHP, HTML, and MySQL.

In a production environment, I would prefer to use an established MVC framework, like Laravel/Lumen.

'reverse/' directory contains the exercise outlined in the Code section, exercise 1.
'forms/' directory contains several files related to Code section, exercise 2.
'sql/' directory contains the create and select statements relating to SQL exercises (implemented in MySQL.)
